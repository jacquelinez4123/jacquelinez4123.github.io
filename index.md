[Efficacy of Raised Pavement Markers](/pdf/BottsDots.pdf) <br>
I conducted a comprehensive analysis on the effectiveness of raised pavement markers in reducing traffic accidents. This involved performing exploratory analysis to identify trends, outliers, and distribution patterns over time. Additionally, I developed and compared Poisson regression and negative binomial regression models. Key skills utilized in this project included regression analysis, model selection, and time series analysis.
